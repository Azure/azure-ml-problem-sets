It is my belief that the truth is generally preferable to lies.
Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.
The best of us sometimes eat our words.
For in dreams we enter a world that is entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.
