## Getting started with the `shrike` problems

- Clone the current repository and set `shrike-examples` as your working directory.
- Set up and activate a new Conda environment:
  `conda create --name shrike-examples-env python=3.7 -y`,
  `conda activate shrike-examples-env`.
- Install the `shrike` dependencies:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
